                <p>This is a review of the questionnaire used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)
                    Security Services and FireEye Inc for their survey on “Cybersecurity
                    Challenges, Risks, Trends, and Impacts”.</p>

                <h4>Review Summary:</h4>
                <p>The type of questions used for the survey were very generic and the options
                    provided were not adequate enough to collect proper statistical data needed
                    for the analysis. ?</p>
                <p>Though initial few questions are focused on identification of the cyber security
                    challenges organization face, the remaining questions challenged the overall
                    objective of the survey itself as those are designed with the intention of
                    identifying chances of selling commercial services to address the challenges. ?</p>
                <p>The question used are more generic in nature and are not designed to
                    specifically identify the People,Process and Technology related cyber security
                    challenges organizations go through.</p>
