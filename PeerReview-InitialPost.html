                <p>This post describes the ACM Code of Ethics and the BCS Code of Conduct in
                    establishing a solid basis of ethical behavior and decision-making in computing
                    using an ACM case study on the Dark UX pattern.</p>
                <p>The author demonstrates how Dark UX patterns misled design patterns to lead
                    people to browse or execute actions in a graphical user interface that they
                    didn't want to do.</p>
                <p>According to the case study, senior executives demanded Dark UX
                    modifications to their e-commerce website to increase refunds due to user
                    mistakes. Furthermore, despite his concerns, the colleague entrusted with
                    making these system adjustments followed his line manager's instructions and
                    made the necessary changes to the GUI.</p>
                <p>The author meticulously recorded the changes made by senior executives and
                    linked each change to a breach of the AMC and BCS codes of conduct. To help
                    the reader comprehend the code, the author has provided the concept and
                    sections of the AMC and BCS codes.</p>
                <p>Finally, the author concludes the paper by outlining the legal operation of
                    whistleblowing.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>The author well-researched the sources and delivered a well-written essay. The
                    author created material that was devoid of grammatical errors and easy to read.
                    The author was successful in conveying the article's context.</p>
