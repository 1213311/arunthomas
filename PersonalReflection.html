                <p>During week 1, I was not very clear of the difference between Research Methods and Professional
                    Practices and even the need of understanding it in detail before the final research. However, after
                    attending the first seminar session, I clearly understood the importance of learning it. The
                    insights shared by the tutor and the collaborative discussions were beneficial in effectively
                    understanding the core concepts and practical usage of research methods.</p>

                <h4>Week 1</h4>
                <p>Readings from the course Ebook and lecture cast covering the research methods fundamentals, helped me
                    improve my knowledge on the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning as listed in below
                    table.</p>

                <p>It was interesting to learn why ethics are important and how they may relate to your area of research
                    and your professional practice.</p>

                <h4>Week 2</h4>
                <p>Topics like characteristics that make up a suitable research topic (summarized in below table),
                    understanding the rational and creative methods for formulating a research idea, means of
                    transforming research ideas into crafted research questions and proposal, how to conduct a
                    literature search, how to critique the literature and to present a literature review etc. were
                    well-explained during the seminar and properly covered in reading materials.</p>

                <h4>Week 3</h4>
                <p>I gained additional knowledge on the different research methods and data collection methods related
                    to each method of research.

                    It was interesting to learn that data collection method may change based on type of research effort
                    needed. This includes and not limited to factors like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The environment where in observations takes place </li>
                    <li>The people involved in the study. </li>
                    <li>The specific activities involved in research </li>
                    <li>Interactions between respondents and researcher (Creswell , 1994)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Week 4</h4>
                <p>
                    Coverage of various data collection tools as mentioned below and selection of proper data analysis
                    method and type of research was the main learning outcome during this week.

                <h4>Week 5</h4>
                <p>
                    This week I have learned how interviews and surveys fit into research and whether either or both
                    might be useful for my research. How pre- and post-testing can be used in research (Salkind N J
                    2010) was something very interesting to learn.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal interviews</li>
                    <li>Online Survey via Websites</li>
                    <li>Telephonic Interviews</li>
                    <li>Email Interviews</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Week 6</h4>
                <p>
                    During this week, I have learned about the difference between a good questionnaire and a poor one,
                    how to design a questionnaire to obtain the responses you will need for your investigation and how
                    the data obtained can be analyzed.

                </p>
                <h5>Good Questionnaire (Crawford IM, 1990) </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Outlined with the purpose of the survey</li>
                    <li>The questions are simple, on point, and easy to understand.</li>
                    <li>Appropriate options especially in your multiple-choice and ranking questions</li>
                    <li>Does not including double-barreled questions</li>
                    <li>Includes neutral answer options when required</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Bad Questionnaire (Crawford IM, 1990) </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The questions are in biased language to influence survey respondents.</li>
                    <li>The questions are complex, vague, and ambiguous.</li>
                    <li>The questions are inheriting biases that prevent respondents from providing objective answers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Requests multiple information at the same time</li>
                    <li>The questions prevent respondents from providing meaningful feedback.</li>
                    <li>The questions are often leads to confusion in the minds of the respondents.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The data obtained will involve analysis on the following steps (Sudman, Bradburn, & Schwarz, 1996)
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Briefing the data required </li>
                    <li>Identifying the relevant data </li>
                    <li>Filtering the data Unambiguously </li>
                    <li>Locating specific data required </li>
                    <li>Arriving at the objective of research</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Week 7</h4>
                <p>
                    This week’s study focused the concepts of validity, generalizability and reliability effect on
                    investigation and the design of research method. Discussions on how to analyze and present the
                    results you obtain from your investigation and how they will enable you to answer your research
                    question was specifically interesting.

                </p>
                <h4>Week 8</h4>
                <p>
                    This week we learned about the different levels of measurement in research and how to produce
                    measures of location and spread in detail. Learnings on how to perform appropriate hypothesis tests
                    helped me complete the exercise activities comfortably.

                </p>
                <h5>Level of measurement </h5>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Diag1.jpg" alt="" /></span>The level of measurement is
                    defined with the relationship between the values that are assigned to the attributes for a variable.

                <div class="clearfix"></div>

                <h5>Produce measures of location and spread. </h5>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Diag2.jpg" alt="" /></span>Measurement involves the
                    construction of an instrument that is associated with qualitative constructs and quantitative metric
                    units. This evolves efforts in psychology and education to measure "unmeasurable". It is the attempt
                    measure abstracts of research concepts. WMK Trochim, JP Donnelly. (2001} </p>

                <div class="clearfix"></div>

                <h5>How to Perform appropriate hypothesis tests. </h5>
                <p>The Hypothesis testing can be performed in 5 main steps (Roger B Davis & Kenneth J Mukamal
                    Originally, 2006)</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stating the research hypothesis as a null (Ho) and alternate (Ha) hypothesis.</li>
                    <li>Collect data to test the hypothesis.</li>
                    <li>Performing an appropriate statistical test.</li>
                    <li>Identifying the data to reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis.</li>
                    <li>Analyzing the findings and discussing the section.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Week 9</h4>
                <p>
                    I have learned about the different types of analysis and how they may be useful for the data
                    collected.<br>

                    The data analysis involves different types of analysis that includes (Attride-Stirling J, 2001)
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Developing research questions and linking them to study designs</li>
                    <li>Understanding differences approaches required and their application</li>
                    <li>Employing different methods for collecting and analyzing qualitative data</li>
                    <li>Involving the methods for collecting quantitative data and basic concepts of probability
                        sampling</li>
                    <li>Understanding descriptive analyses for quantitative data</li>
                    <li>Interpreting multiple sources of data and develop evidence-based conclusions and recommendations
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Understanding the different charts available to present the different types of data you have obtained
                    was very useful.</p>

                </div>

                <h4>Week 10</h4>
                <p>
                    Understanding how to structure a dissertation and how to prepare yourself for the writing was the
                    key learning point of this week.</p>

                <p> The dissertation is an academic project that marks your transition from student to scholar. Writing
                    a dissertation is like writing a book. It is a self-directed process done within a weekly deadline,
                    it does not involve regular discussions with classmates, reading assignments, or one telling what
                    needs to be done—This is done independently and the process involves. (Bulker Joan, 1998)

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Figuring out where to work and planning dissertation work hours. </li>
                    <li>Investigate graduation requirements</li>
                    <li>Making a list of all the little things that needs to be done for a given sections of the
                        dissertation</li>
                    <li>Working on acknowledgements</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Week 11</h4>
                <p>
                    More of this week’s efforts was on e-learning portfolio preparation. Activities related to it helped
                    me self-review the need of learning the right way.</p>

                <h4>Week 12</h4>
                <p>
                    This week’s learnings included fundamental concepts of project management, project life cycle and
                    methodologies, technologies/software needed to support remote collaboration, how projects can be
                    impacted by risk and uncertainty and how to control risk and manage project change effectively.</p>
                <p>Risk can be identified and evaluated. All project teams should develop a risk mitigation plan, which
                    is a plan to reduce the impact of an unexpected event, by grouping the risk in the following phase
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk avoidance</li>
                    <li>Risk sharing</li>
                    <li>Risk reduction</li>
                    <li>Risk transfer</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>1.2 Reading – What did I read and watch</h3>
                <p>I referred to the eBook [1] and sources listed in references below thoroughly, and the lecture casts
                    and seminar recordings of the modules were also very helpful.</p>
                <h3>1.3 Writing </h3>
                <p>I have actively participated in the first collaborative discussions with a well-researched post. I
