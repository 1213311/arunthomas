                <p>Data collection tools suitable for the research investigation on
                    the research proposal:“Implementing Cyber Security tools
                    and/or techniques for the reduction of Cyberbullying - Tools
                    and/or techniques for the reducing Cyber-bullying”</p>
                <p>The concept of cyberbullying is an intense issue, and mounting
                    with time, it occurs in different ways than it did when it initially
                    surfaced. With advances in technology, especially with the flexibility
                    of Smart Phones, Tools and/or techniques for reducing
                    Cyberbullying should be effective with the upgrading technology.</p>

                <h4>How will you collect it and what analysis would you hope to perform?</h4>
                <p>The analysis will be conducted with a mixed methods explanatory
                    design (Creswell & Clark, 2007). In two phases, phase one consists
                    of quantitative data collection; phase two involves collecting
                    qualitative data that links the data from phase one (Creswell &
                    Clark, 2007). The participant selection model of the explanatory
                    design will be used. The model involves quantitative data obtained
                    from the first phase to decisively select the participants for
                    interviews for the next phase of the qualitative portion (Creswell &
                    Clark, 2007).</p>
                <p> The quantitative data for the study is done through a crosssectional
                    survey, collecting all the data at a single point to
                    understand the current views on the issue (Creswell,2008). The survey aims to determine Tools and/or
                    techniques for reducing
                    Cyberbullying.</p>
                <p>The qualitative data obtained in this study are from interviews
                    conducted with the participants who were identified during the
                    first phase of the study. The participants in phase two are selected
                    through purposeful sampling, as their survey data will indicate an
                    existing effective policy related to cyberbullying (Creswell, 2008). A
                    phenomenological approach is employed to understand the aspect
                    of the phenomenon faced by each individual. Each participant
                    selected will be engaged in a one-on-one interview with the
                    researcher. The interview involves open-ended questions related to
                    their approach to cyberbullying, as Open-ended questions help the
                    participant to explain their stories without restriction (Creswell,
                    2008).</p>
                <p>The results of the qualitative portion of the study will identify the
                    major essential for effective cyberbullying Tools and/or techniques,
                    specifically:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The importance of cyberbullying reporting procedure;</li>
                    <li>Cyberbullying prevention training integration;</li>
                    <li>Victim-centered approach</li>
                    <li>Medium of cyberbullying prevention training such as
                        Broadcast Journalism;</li>
                    <li>A focus on prevention rather than punishment;</li>
                    <li>The importance of punishment as a part of formulating
                        effective policy;</li>
                    <li>Coping with the changes in technology.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>How will this data collection tool and processes answer your
                    research questions like:</h3>
                <h4>How cyberbullying is anonymous and takes place anywhere?</h4>
                <p>The analysis will observe the perspective of the victims, so “Tools
                    and/or techniques” of cyberbullying prevention or intervention will
                    be clearly defined. The issue will be understood from the
                    perspective of addressing the consequence effectively with the
                    actions directly related to cyberbullying.</p>



                <h4>What all are the different types of tools or resources
                    available to resist Cyberbullying?</h4>

                    bullying and cyberbullying.</p>
                <p>"A Thin Line" - Athinline is the website with the extension of .org
                    that provides facts on digital abuse and cyberbullying, helping the
                    visitors to learn how to deal with the situation.</p>
                <p>CyberSmart website with an extension .org is an MTV initiative
                    along with "A Thin Line", to end digital abuse; the network enlists
                    cybercrime experts, psychologists, and youth activists (Whelan D L,
                    2011).</p>
                <p>Many websites like MySpace and other social media portals allow
                    users to report abusers and bullies by accessing a link in the user
                    profile. Facebook has an option to e-mail the instances at
                    abuse@facebook.com to report any misuse of their portal.</p>

                <strong>-Netiquette</strong>
                <p>Netiquette is a set of rules for Internet etiquette, listed on the
                    metsmartz website with an extension .org, focusing on reducing
                    disinhibited behavior online (Shea S E, 1994). The iSafe Internet
                    Safety Program (i-SAFE Inc, 1998, 2009) is a subscription-based
                    prevention program for students in Grades K–12. Further, the
                    program is available via DVD Nersmarta or in-person training, the
                    parents and community leaders are provided with a professional

                <p>The Bully Block app helps the user to block unwanted text
                    messages, calls, and pictures for Android phones. With the help of
                    the app, one can also record a secret file and send the information
                    to the victim's trusted person (Poland S, 2010).</p>
                <p>Despite the above measures, it is widely recommended that the
                    victims start talking about the incidences of bullying to a person
                    with whom they are comfortable and report such instances
                    immediately (Frey K S, Hirschstein M K, Edstrom L V, & Snell J L,
                    2009)</p>

                <h4>What all are the different types of tools or resources
                    available to resist Cyberbullying?</h4>
                <p>The analysis will be implemented as per the description of Fowler‟s,
                    2004 description process, which consists of six sections, namely:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Definition of the Issue – Cyberbullying should be recognized
                        as other social problem, to establish Tools and/or techniques
                        for reducing it, as this will support in addressing them
                        effectively.</li>
                    <li>
                        Setting an agenda – Post identification the problem must be
                        placed on the agenda to become a policy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Formulation of Policy – Adopting a policy should have various
                        levels of scrutiny that are expressed in writing. As these
                        policies turn into rules and regulations post several drafts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adopting policy –The written formulation will be presented to
                        the authorized officials for establishing a policy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implementation – The implementation starts from the
                        grassroots level of motivating educators to implement.
                    </li>
