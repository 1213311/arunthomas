                <p>The reviewed case study describes Rogue Services that advertised its hosting
                    web service as "Cheap, Guaranteed Uptime, No matter what." In this digital era,
                    where people rely primarily on internet-based applications, malicious viruses
                    and spam spread across the web. Web hosting services worldwide take the first
                    step in defending against these spam and malware distribution services in their
                    servers. [1]</p>
                <p>However, the Rogue Web hosting providers' dependability guarantee enabled
                    numerous botnets to protect their command-and-control servers from takedown
                    attempts. Rogue providers declined to intervene with these services
                    despite repeated demands from major ISPs and international groups, claiming
                    their "no matter what" promise to its consumers. [1]</p>

                <h4>Violations by Rogue Services:</h4>
                <p>Firstly, Rogue providers developed its business globally, although its laws were
                    based in a nation where such hosting operations were not sufficiently
                    prohibited. [1]</p>
                <p> Under professional competence and integrity, the BCS code of conduct
                    stipulates that you must ensure that you know and comprehend legislation and
                    comply with it when carrying out your professional obligations. When a rogue
                    provider violated the code, it triggered worldwide pressure from other
                    governments, which failed to compel national-level action. [3]
                    Rogue providers also broke the BCS's Duty of Relevant Authority code, which
                    requires professionals to carry out their duties with care and attention in line
                    with the Relevant Authority's standards while using professional judgment at all
                    times. [3]</p>
                <p>As a result, the Rogue provider services enabled harmful malware to be hosted
                    on their servers, causing harm to their customers. This violates ethical code
                    principles 1.1 and 1.2, which stipulate that one should contribute to society and
                    human well-being, recognize that all people are stakeholders in computers, and
                    prevent damage. [2]</p>
                <p>It also breaks the BCS code of Public Interest by neglecting to consider public
                    health, privacy, security, and the well-being of others, as well as the
                    environment. According to the BCS code of professional competence and
                    integrity, dishonest, intentional, or negligent conduct or inaction should not
                    cause harm to others, their property, reputation, or employment. The breach in
                    our case study was caused by the company's negligence, which resulted in
                    damage to its users. [3] </p>
                <p>According to Ethics code principle 2.8, Professionals in computing should not
                    access the computers, software or data of the other person unless they have a
                    reasonable belief in this or a strong opinion in the public interest. [2]
                    The mere fact that a system is publicly accessible is insufficient to infer
                    authorization. Rogue providers did not consider the public interest, although
                    their ISP was aware that their computers were hosting code that generated
                    infections that were not permitted. [1]</p>

                <h4>Denial-of-Service attack:</h4>
                <p>Rogue providers were eventually brought offline forcibly through concerted
                    operations involving numerous security firms and several government entities.
                    This was attained through the use of a targeted worm that propagated
                    throughout Rogue's network. Rogue's computers were successfully taken
                    offline by this denial-of-service (DoS) attack, destroying most of the data kept
                    with the ISP. [1]</p>
                <p>Since the malware includes measures to prevent its propagation, no other ISPs
                    reported any damage from it. Spam and botnet traffic decreased dramatically
                    as a result of this move. In addition, fresh ransomware attacks of all types have
                    ceased. However, this assault impacted all of Rogue's clients. [1]</p>

                <h4>Legalities of DoS attack:</h4>
                <p>This instance demonstrates a critical aspect of Principle 1.2, according to the
                    worm authors. Given that the worm was created with the express purpose of
                    inflicting harm to Rogue's systems, the creators had an ethical obligation to
                    verify that the damage was justified. [2]</p>
                <p>The worm was successful in shutting down online services that were dangerous
                    and malicious. The worm's intention is in line with the moral responsibilities
                    outlined in Principle 1.1. Furthermore, the worm incorporated safeguards that
                    limited it to Rogue's systems, showing an effort to avoid accidental harm. [2]
                    The virus gained unauthorized access to Rogue's systems, deleting data in the
                    process. The objective of addressing harmful software, on the other hand,
                    indicates strong confidence that the service interruption was in the public
                    interest. [4]</p>



                <h4>The professionalism of computer specialists:</h4>
                <p>According to BCS, computer professionals should embrace personal
                    responsibility for upholding the profession's reputation and refrain from taking
                    any actions that could jeopardize the profession's reputation. They should
                    participate in the creation, application, and enforcement of professional
                    standards to enhance them. [3]</p>
                <p>However, in this case study, Rogue's professionals failed to retain their
                    professionalism with their customers and coworkers. [1]</p>

                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
                <p>The case study clearly shows the harmful consequences of web hosting
                    services' negligence and poor assurances. It explains how a firm that provides
                    services to overseas clients should be aware of and comply with the regulations
                    of the client country. Failure to do so results in social pressure, and laws are
                    also thoroughly discussed.</p>
                <p>The worm authors' decision to shut down the Rogue online services was
                    morally justified by citing relevant regulations. It would be preferable if the
                    worm authors could protect the data of the Rogue servers' independent webbased
                    retailers.</p>

                <h3>Peer Response - Post by Anrich Potgieter</h3>
                <p>Hi Arun</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much for sharing your insights into this case study.
                    I find this case study incredibly ethically complex. As we have observed in the
                    case study provided, we can see that Rogue violated several BCS principles;
                    however, as stated in the case study, they operated from a country that did not
                    legislate or prevent such hosting activities (‘Case: Malware Disruption - ACM
                    Ethics’, 2018).</p>
                    <p>The BCS code of ethics does provide a fantastic ethical foundation for
                    computing professionals; however, as the owners of Rogue were operating
                    outside of the United Kingdom in a region where their actions were technically
                    legal, I wonder whether they had an altered sense of computing ethics. They
                    seemed to have a self-assigned ethical standpoint regarding their service
                    delivery to their customers.</p>
                   <p> I find that applying principles from the BCS code of ethics on an entity that
                    does not operate within the constructs of the framework to be dangerous and
                    potentially illegal. In the case study, we see how various organisations and
                    governments justified the creation of a worm to take down the Rogue systems
                    by making ethical justifications within the code of ethics. From my standpoint, I
                    believe that governments and organisations need to take a legal perspective
                    and exhaust all legal options before making ethically justified actions.
                    Finally, I completely agree with you that the worm authors should have
                    considered all users making use of the Rouge platform. Some legitimate
                    businesses would have lost their data and significant parts of their businesses.</p>
