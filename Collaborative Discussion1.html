							<p>The reviewed case study describes Rogue Services that advertised its hosting
                                web service as "Cheap, Guaranteed Uptime, No matter what." In this digital era,
                                where people rely primarily on internet-based applications, malicious viruses
                                and spam spread across the web. Web hosting services worldwide take the first
                                step in defending against these spam and malware distribution services in their
                                servers. [1]</p>
							<p>However, the Rogue Web hosting providers' dependability guarantee enabled
                                numerous botnets to protect their command-and-control servers from takedown
                                attempts. Rogue providers declined to intervene with these services
                                despite repeated demands from major ISPs and international groups, claiming
                                their "no matter what" promise to its consumers. [1]</p>
                                <h4>Violations by Rogue Services:</h4>
                                <p>Firstly, Rogue providers developed its business globally, although its laws were
                                    based in a nation where such hosting operations were not sufficiently
                                    prohibited. [1]</p>
                                <p> Under professional competence and integrity, the BCS code of conduct
                                    stipulates that you must ensure that you know and comprehend legislation and
                                    comply with it when carrying out your professional obligations. When a rogue
                                    provider violated the code, it triggered worldwide pressure from other
                                    governments, which failed to compel national-level action. [3]
                                    Rogue providers also broke the BCS's Duty of Relevant Authority code, which
                                    requires professionals to carry out their duties with care and attention in line
                                    with the Relevant Authority's standards while using professional judgment at all
                                    times. [3]</p>
