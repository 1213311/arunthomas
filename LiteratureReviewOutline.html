                <h4>Case Study: Cambridge Analytica misusing on Facebook user’s data:</h4>
                <p>Cambridge Analytica is a federal marketing, data analytics, and consulting
                    business located in London, United Kingdom. The company has facilities in
                    London, New York, and Washington, DC. Cambridge Analytica has been accused
                    of obtaining Facebook data inappropriately and planning a variety of national
                    crusades. [1]</p>
                <p>These crusades include American Senator Ted Cruz and, to a lesser extent,
                    Donald Trump and the Leave-EU Brexit campaign that resulted in the UK's
                    withdrawal from the EU.</p>
                <p>In spring 2018, the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal was a massive
                    setback. Cambridge Analytica obtained the private data of millions of people's
                    Facebook profiles without their permission and used it for Political Advertising.
                    It was dubbed a "watershed moment" in the country's knowledge of private data,
                    prompting a 17% drop in Facebook's cut rate and calls for stricter laws
                    governing tech companies' use of personal data. [1]</p>

                <h3>Methodology:</h3>
                <h4>Data Collection:</h4>
                <p>CA collaborated with Aleksandr Kogan, a UK research professor, to develop a
                    Facebook quiz app to understand user psychology. Facebook's terms of service at
                    the time indicated that the developer was entitled to harvest user data for
                    research purposes but did not specify whether the developer was also permitted
                    to gather the data of the user's friends. [2]</p>
                <p> Users were required to log in to their Facebook accounts to complete the survey.
                    Users would have to authorize the App to access their user data when they log
                    into the App. Although they only approved data collection for their user data,
                    they unintentionally allowed data collection for their friend's user data as
                    well. [2]</p>
                <p>Their information includes their name, gender, location, ethnicity, education
                    level, favorite pages, clothing brand, etc. The professor/CA was able to gather
                    information from 75 million nodes. [2]</p>
                <h4>Data Management:</h4>
                <p>User profiles were established for each person based on the data obtained, and
                    they have been categorized accordingly. The user profiles were created based on
                    where they lived in the United States. Users' political affinities were deduced
                    based on the brand of clothes they wore. As a result, user profiles were further
                    refined based on their beliefs, such as conservative or liberal.</p>
                <p>Based on OCEAN scores, classification algorithms were employed to categorize
                    user profiles. The OCEAN scores represent the user's level of Openness,
                    Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. [2]</p>

                <h4>Machine Learning:</h4>
                <p>Regression was used to build a Machine Learning model on accessible data sets
                    to predict the political affiliation of a new user. The user's profile, including
                    psychographic data, their Facebook activity, and the OCEAN score, was combined
                    to forecast political allegiance information. The user's concerns about specific
                    policies and the improvements the user would want to see the government adopt
                    were taken into account by the Machine Learning Model. [2]</p>


                <h4>Micro-targeting:</h4>
                <p>The Model's output is utilized to construct a good Campaign. Advertisements are
                    displayed to people based on their political preferences. Advertisements with
                    psychographic micro-targeting are presented so that they either strengthen or
                    reinforce a user's preconceived notions about a particular party. The advertising
                    is well-tailored to the psychographics of the users, intending to achieve
                    maximum results. [2]</p>




                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>Users who lived in border areas were concerned about immigration. Therefore
                    they were grouped with anti-immigration voters. Users in the hinterlands were
                    worried about job losses and the development of oil and gas pipelines through
                    Native American settlements. Therefore they were grouped while creating
                    profiles. Net Worth: Extremely High Tax breaks were a significant issue for those
                    living in wealthy suburbs or downtown regions. Thus it was a substantial
                    component in their profile construction. [1]</p>
                <p>If a user is worried about immigration policy (Anti-immigration User Profile
                    Class), advertising detailing how a specific party is working in that area will be
                    targeted. [1]</p>

                <h4>Breach Consequences:</h4>
                <p>In March 2018, Christopher Wylie, a former GSR employee, revealed the data
                    collecting operation. Many users were concerned and demanded stricter
                    restrictions on their personal information. Others were even considering
                    deactivating their Facebook accounts.</p>
                <p>Indeed, with the viral hashtag #deletefacebook, a rising campaign to delete
                    Facebook quickly spread worldwide. Financially, Facebook's stock price dropped
                    7% the day following the incident, and it's market worth fell by more than $36
                    billion. [4]</p>


                <h4>Facebook’s Reaction:</h4>
                <p>Facebook's initial reaction on the day Wylie's revelations were made public was
                    to deny how the press presented the event. On the network's blog, Paul Grewal,
                    the company's deputy general counsel, stated that Aleksandr Kogan solicited and
                    obtained information from users who decided to sign up for his App and that
                    everyone engaged granted their agreement defended the social media's soft
                    rules. [3]</p>
                <p>Later, the business realized that blaming customers for not comprehending its
                    complicated privacy rules was not the most excellent strategy, especially given
                    the public outcry. On March 21, five days after the CA data scandal was revealed,
                    Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence. [3]</p>
                <p>Users were warned that the access they had allowed to various programs would
                    be withdrawn and examined in the settings, in addition to their audit trials on
                    breach investigation. Meanwhile, Facebook has pledged to create an app that
                    would require users to erase all of their Facebook web search data. [4]</p>

                <h4>Changes in Policy:</h4>
                <p>Logical data security regulations became effective across Europe on May 25,
                    2018, through The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective.
                    It implies to all companies that prepare private data about EU citizens, regardless
                    of their location. Processing is a general phrase that refers to everything linked to
                    personal data, such as how a company handles and uses data, including settling,
                    preserving, using, and destroying it. [4]</p>
                <p>While many of the GDPR's provisions are based on EU data protection legislation,
                    the GDPR has a more extensive reach, more specific restrictions, and substantial
                    penalties. [4]</p>
                <p>Though specific programs may undergo modifications or upgrades, the
                    platform user should be aware of the types of personal data and applications to
                    which they should provide rights.</p>
